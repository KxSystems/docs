The q language derives from the notation devised by Harvard mathematician [Kenneth E. Iverson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_E._Iverson).

Many powerful techniques for programming in q originally appeared in earlier Iversonian languages, which can reward study by q programmers.

[Try APL](https://tryapl.org)

: APL (A Programming Language) was the first language derived from Iverson notation. At this site you can see it with its original elegant symbols. 

[Jsoftware wiki](https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/Main_Page)

: J was Iverson’s from-the-ground-up reboot of APL in 1990.

[no stinking loops](http://www.nsl.com) 

: Stevan Apter’s personal website is a treasure chest for k programmers.

[_Vector_](https://vector.org.uk) 

: The journal of the British APL Association has recorded work in the Iversonian languages since 1984.
