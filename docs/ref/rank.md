# `rank`







_Position in the sorted list_

```syntax
rank x    rank[x]
```

Where `x` is a list or dictionary, returns for each item in `x` the index of where it would occur in the sorted list or dictionary. 

This is the same as calling [`iasc`](asc.md#iasc) twice on the list.

```q
q)rank 2 7 3 2 5
0 4 2 1 3
q)iasc 2 7 3 2 5
0 3 2 4 1
q)iasc iasc 2 7 3 2 5            / same as rank
0 4 2 1 3
q)asc[2 7 3 2 5] rank 2 7 3 2 5  / identity
2 7 3 2 5
q)iasc idesc 2 7 3 2 5           / descending rank
3 0 2 4 1
```
