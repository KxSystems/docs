# <i class="fas fa-pen-nib"></i> Style guide


Here are typographical, spelling and lexical conventions for the content of this site.


## Scope

They apply to 

-   Markdown source files for code.kx.com, hosted at <i class="fab fa-github"></i> [KxSystems/docs](https://github.com/kxsystems/docs)
-   Technical Whitepapers prepared as PDFs for code.kx.com 

## Purpose

The object of these conventions is to remove ambiguity. In practice, they rarely do, because in most instances of potential ambiguity the author’s intent can be deduced by an intelligent reader. 

The conventions are nonethless valuable, because occasionally they have important work to do. 
For example:

> The adverb _over_ (`/`) is to be preferred over the operator `over`.

!!! important "The value of consistency"
    
    Consistent observation of the conventions relieves the reader of the cognitive load of resolving ambiguities, and raises the value of the documentation. 


## Summary

Here are the most important – or the most commonly neglected – rules.

-   Use **American spelling**, e.g. _customize_ not _customise_
-   Use the **revised terminology** to describe the grammar of q
-   Use **sentence case** for headings, with minimal punctuation and no final periods, e.g. _Coding conventions for interfaces_, not _Coding Conventions for Interfaces._
-   Use **italic type** for emphasis and **bold type** for keywords to assist a visual search. 
-   Use **spaced endashes** for parenthetical phrases – such as this – not spaced hyphens and not emdashes, spaced or unspaced. 
-   Use **numbered lists** (or headings) only when there are multiple references to the numbers; otherwise use bulleted lists. 
-   In Markdown use **code fences** to delimit code blocks, and label them with the corresponding language, e.g. ` ```q `.
-   Use [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) to proof your text before submitting it for review.
