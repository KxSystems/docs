# <i class="fas fa-life-ring"></i> Support


We are proud to provide industry-acclaimed support for our customers, starting with free, onsite evaluations for qualified prospects with application requirements well-suited for Kx technology.

We pride ourselves on being highly responsive to customer needs, typically responding to technical inquiries within minutes, and offering solutions within the day; these are responses from knowledgeable staff who are familiar with the code at a very deep level, not scripted responses from an outsourced support center.

Beyond this, we offer a full ecosystem of resources – of both the material and the human variety – that enhances the experiences of our customers.
