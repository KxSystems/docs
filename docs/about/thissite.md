# About this site


This site is the official documentation for [kdb+](../database/index.md) and the [q programming language](../ref/index.md).

It reflects the work of the KX community since 1993, has many authors,
and continues to evolve.

This site is a project of the KX Librarian: librarian@kx.com.

> A librarian’s job is to put information where people can find it.

The Search Box on this site is customized for the q language.
