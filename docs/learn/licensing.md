## Who needs a license for kdb+?

Everyone. All use of kdb+ is governed by a license. 

64-bit installations require a **license key file**: `k4.lic` or `kc.lic`.

<!-- :fontawesome-regular-hand-point-right: [Licenses](https://kx.com/connect-with-us/licenses/) at kx.com -->


=== "Non-commercial use"

    Free 64-bit kdb+ On-Demand Personal Edition is for personal, non-commercial use. 
    Currently, it may be used on up to 2 computers, and up to a maximum of 16 cores per computer, but is not licensed for use on any cloud – only on personal computers. 
    It may not be used for any commercial purposes.
    See the [full terms and conditions](https://kx.com/developers/download-licenses/). 

    It requires a `kc.lic` license key file and an always-on internet connection to operate.


=== "Commercial use"

    Use of commercial kdb+ is covered by your license agreement with KX.

    Your copy of kdb+ will need access to a valid license key file.

    If you wish to begin using kdb+ commercially, please contact sales@kx.com.


## License key files

All 64-bit versions of kdb+ need a valid license key file to run.
Without one, kdb+ signals an [error](../basics/errors.md#license-errors) `'k4.lic` and aborts.

```txt
tom@mb13:~/q$ q
KDB+ 3.6 2018.07.30 Copyright (C) 1993-2018 Kx Systems
m64/ 2()core 8192MB tom mb13.local 192.168.1.44
'k4.lic
tom@mb13:~/q$ 
```

The license key file is `k4.lic`, or `kc.lic` for kdb+ On Demand.
If both are found, the `kc.lic` file is used.

(The 32-bit kdb+ distribution does not require a license key file.)


## Obtain a license key file

### On-Demand

License key files (`kc.lic`) are distributed by email. 

:fontawesome-solid-hand-point-right: [Request an On-Demand license key file](https://ondemand.kx.com/)


### Commercial

An unlicensed kdb+ session aborts: see above.
The banner at the top of the aborted session contains machine-configuration information but no license information. 

Your Designated Contact sends a copy of the banner to licadmin@kx.com to request a license file by return. 

??? info "Designated Contact"

    Each KX customer designates to licadmin@kx.com two technical people as the Designated Contacts for issues with kdb+, managing licenses and downloading software. 


## Install the license key file

Save a copy of the license key file (`k4.lic` or `kc.lic`) in the `QHOME` folder. 
(See [installation instructions](install.md#install) for your operating system.) 
Restart your kdb+ session and note the change in the banner. 

```txt
tom@mb13:~/q$ q
KDB+ 3.6 2018.07.30 Copyright (C) 1993-2018 Kx Systems
m64/ 2()core 8192MB tom mb13.local 192.168.1.44 EXPIRE 2019.05.15 tom@kx.com #400
q)til 6
0 1 2 3 4 5
q)
```

Note the license number (`#400` in the example) and quote it in any correspondence about the license. 

If you are sharing use of a commercial license, you will probably want to set the environment variable `QLIC` to the path of the license key file, as below.


## Keeping the license key file elsewhere

The default location for the license key file is the `QHOME` folder. You do not have to keep the license key file there. You can use the environment variable `QLIC` to specify a different filepath.

??? tip "Folder not file"

    Like `QHOME`, `QLIC` points to a folder, not a file. For example,

    ```bash
    QLIC='/Users/simon/q'
    ```


## Licensing server for kdb+ On Demand

As well as a license key file, kdb+ On Demand also requires frequent contact with the KX licensing server. 
For this you need an always-on Net connection.

If kdb+ cannot contact the KX server it will abort with a timestamped message.

```q
'2018.03.28T11:20:03.831 couldn't connect to license daemon -- exiting
```


## Core restrictions

If the license is for fewer cores than the total number on the machine, the number of cores available to kdb+ must be [restricted with OS programs](../kb/cpu-affinity.md), or kdb+ will signal `'cores` and abort.

```txt
KDB+ 3.6 2018.07.30 Copyright (C) 1993-2018 Kx Systems
m64/ 4(3)core 16384MB simon simon-macos.local 127.0.0.1   simon@kx.com #40000

'cores
```

As long as you use `taskset` or `numa` correctly, the binary will not abort itself.

You can see the number of cores entitled to a q process:

-   by looking at the banner, e.g. `…m64/ 4(3)core…` – the 4 here is the number of cores reported by the OS, and the 3 is the number of cores licensed 
-   with [`.z.c`](../ref/dotz.md#zc-cores) – not the physical cores of the system, but rather the number the process is allowed to use
-   the first element of [`.z.l`](../ref/dotz.md#zl-license) 

The number of licensed cores is always 16 for the on-demand license.

??? warning "On the road"

    The license key file binds the interpreter to your computer’s hostname.
    For example, for a Mac named `mymbp` the hostname might be `mymbp.local`.
    When traveling you may find a network has changed the hostname, for example to `mymbp.lan` or `mymbp.fritz.box`. Kdb+ then signals a host error on launch. 

    Linux and macOS users can restore their hostnames from the command shell, e.g. 

    ```bash
    scutil --set HostName "mymbp.local"
    ```


## License questions

Designated Contacts should send license questions to licadmin@kx.com. 

## Emergency failover licenses

In case of an emergency, such as a hardware or infrastructure failure that renders your license key file unusable, the Designated Contact can email failover@kx.com to request a temporary failover license to allow use of a different machine or IP address.
