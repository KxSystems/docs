# Geospatial indexing



This demo shows the basics of geospatial indexing with q.

A 1-million-point random data set is queried from the HTML map client. Click on the map to see nearby points. 

Download :fontawesome-brands-github: [KxSystems/kdb/e/geo.zip](https://github.com/KxSystems/kdb/blob/master/e/geo.zip) and run:

```bash
$ make -C s2
$ q q/geo.q
$ open html/geo.html
```


This should then open a browser, connect to the kdb+ process and retrieve `geo.html`, displayed similar to:

![map](../img/geo.png)

There are five text fields in the top row:

-   Last-click coordinates 
-   Number of returned results 
-   Min date* 
-   Max date* 
-   Lookup rectangle size* (degrees)

Those marked with * are editable filters.

When the mouse is clicked on the map, the underlying lat-lon coordinates are sent to the kdb+ process along with the filters over a websocket connection, and the points in the response are then plotted on the map. In addition to coordinates, kdb+ returns a `trk` column, which the client interprets as point colour.

This uses the [Google S2 library](http://blog.christianperone.com/2015/08/googles-s2-geometry-on-the-sphere-cells-and-hilbert-curve/) as a kdb+ shared object.

To create the index, the function `ids[lats;lons]` maps (lat-lon) coordinates on a sphere to one-dimensional cell IDs. These are stored as 32-bit integers with the `` `p`` attribute applied.

`lu`, defined in `geo.q` as

```q
{[x;y]select from pl rect . x where all(lat;lon;time)within'(x,enlist y)}
```

retrieves points contained in the given spherical rectangle. `lu` takes the rectangle coordinates with a time filter, and calculates the coverage (ranges of cells covering the rectangle) with `rect[(lat0;lat1);(lon0;lon1)]`. The cell ID ranges are looked up with `pl`, defined in `geo.q` as

```q
{raze{select[x]lat,lon,trk,time from geo}each flip deltas geo.cid binr/:x}
```

The result is then filtered to remove points outside the rectangle (since the covering might exceed the rectangle dimensions) and to constrain by time.

The simple HTML interface is implemented with [openstreetmap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) and [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com).
