# Unit tests





The goal of unit tests is to check that the individual parts of a program are correct. 
Unit tests provide a written contract that a piece of code must satisfy.

[Unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing)

Q supports unit testing with the script `k4unit.q`, which loads test descriptions from CSV files, runs the tests, and writes results to a table.

## Starting

To use k4unit, you first have to load the script file

```bash
q k4unit.q -p 5001
```


## Test descriptions

### Writing descriptions

Tests descriptions are written in a CSV file, with the following format:

```csv
action, ms, lang, code
```

The meaning of each column is as follows.

column | description                                                                | notes                                                 
-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------
code   | code to be executed                                                        | if your code contains commas enclose it all in quotes.
lang   | `k` or `q`                                                                 | if empty, default is `q`                                
ms     | max milliseconds it should take to run                                     | if 0, ignore                                          
action | `beforeany`, `beforeeach`, `before`, `run`, `true`, `fail`, `after`, `aftereach`, `afterall` | See below for description           

Where the actions have the following meaning:

action     | description                              
-----------|------------------------------------------
beforeany  | one time, run code before any tests      
beforeeach | run code before tests in every file      
before     | run code before tests in this file       
run        | run code, check execution time against ms
true       | run code, check if returns true(`1b`)    
fail       | run code, it should fail (e.g. `2+two`)  
after      | run code after tests in this file        
aftereach  | run code after tests in each file        
afterall   | one time, run code after all tests       

!!! note "Fail is not false"

    `` `fail`` is not `"false"`, nor the opposite of `` `true``. 
    If your code returns `0b` when correct, use `not` to make it true. 


### Example descriptions

```csv
comment,0,,this will be ignored
before,,k,aa::22
before,0,k,aa::22
before,0,q,aa::22
before,0,q,aa::22
true,0,k,2=+/1 1
true,0,q,2=sum 1 1
true,0,k,2=sum 1 1
true,0,k,(*/2 2)~+/2 2
true,0,k,(*/2 2)~+/2 3
run,10,k,do[100;+/1.1+!10000]
fail,0,q,2=`aa
after,0,k,bb::33
before,0,k,aa::22
before,0,k,aa::22
```

### Loading descriptions

When the script `k4unit.q` is loaded, it creates the table `KUT` (KUnit Tests). It’s empty initially:

```q
q)KUT
action ms lang code file
------------------------
```

and will contain test descriptions after tests are loaded with `KUltf`.

Invoke the function `KUltf` (load test file) with a file name as its argument.

```q
q)KUltf `:sample.csv
15
q)KUT
action  ms bytes  lang code          repeat minver file        comment
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
comment 0  0      q                  1      0      :sample.csv “this will just be ignored”
before  0  0      k    aa::22        1      0      :sample.csv “”
before  0  0      k    aa::22        1      0      :sample.csv “”
before  0  0      q    aa::22        1      0      :sample.csv “”
before  0  0      q    aa::22        1      0      :sample.csv “comment ”
true    0  0      k    2=+/1 1       1      0      :sample.csv “”
true    0  0      q    2=sum 1 1     1      0      :sample.csv “”
true    0  0      k    2=sum 1 1     1      0      :sample.csv “”
true    0  0      k    (*/2 2)~+/2 2 1      0      :sample.csv “”
true    0  0      k    (*/2 2)~+/2 3 1      0      :sample.csv “”
run     75 492264 k    +/1.1+!10000  1000   0      :sample.csv “a few times”
fail    0  0      q    2=`aa         1      0      :sample.csv “”
after   0  0      k    bb::33        1      0      :sample.csv “”
before  0  0      k    aa::22        1      0      :sample.csv “”
before  0  0      k    aa::22        1      0      :sample.csv “”
```

It is possible to load multiple description files in the same directory with `KUltd` (load test dir). This

```q
KUltd `:dirname
```

loads all CSVs in that directory into table `KUT`.


## Running unit tests

Invoke `KUrt` (run tests) with an empty argument list

```q
q)KUrt[]
2018.11.06T15:31:06.981 start
2018.11.06T15:31:06.981 :sample.csv 7 test(s)
2018.11.06T15:31:07.006 end
7
```


## Test results

### Inspecting results

When k4unit is loaded, it creates the table `KUTR` (KUnit Test Results). It's empty initially

```q
q)KUTR
action ms lang code file msx ok okms valid timestamp
----------------------------------------------------
```

and will contain results of unit tests after `KUrt[]` is invoked. Results can be inspected by showing the whole table

```q
q)KUT
q)KUTR
action ms bytes  lang code          repeat file        msx bytesx ok okms okbytes valid timestamp
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
true   0  0      k    2=+/1 1       1      :sample.csv 0   0      1  1    1       1     2018.11.06T15:31:06.982
true   0  0      q    2=sum 1 1     1      :sample.csv 0   0      1  1    1       1     2018.11.06T15:31:06.982
true   0  0      k    2=sum 1 1     1      :sample.csv 0   0      1  1    1       1     2018.11.06T15:31:06.982

true   0  0      k    (*/2 2)~+/2 3 1      :sample.csv 0   0      0  1    1       1     2018.11.06T15:31:06.982
run    75 492264 k    +/1.1+!10000  1000   :sample.csv 24  393936 1  1    1       1     2018.11.06T15:31:07.006
fail   0  0      q    2=`aa         1      :sample.csv 0   0      1  1    1       1     2018.11.06T15:31:07.006
```

or by using q queries. For instance:

```q
q)show select from KUTR where not ok
q)show select from KUTR where not okms
q)show select count i by ok,okms,action from KUTR
q)show select count i by ok,okms,action,file from KUTR
```

The fields `action`, `ms`, `lang`, and `code` are as described above. The rest are as follows:

column    | description                                                 | notes                                
----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------
file      | name of test descriptions file                              |                                      
msx       | milliseconds taken to eXecute code                          |                                      
ok        | true if the test completes correctly                        | it is correct for a fail task to fail
okms      | true if msx is not greater than ms, ie if performance is ok |                                      
valid     | true if the code is valid (ie doesn't crash)                | fail code is valid if it fails       
timestamp | when test was run                                           |                                      


### Saving results to disk

Invoking the function `KUstr[]` saves the table `KUtr` to a file KUTR.csv.


## Restarting

The functions `KUit` and `KUitr` initialize the tables `KUT` and `KUTR` to empty.


## Configuration parameters

When the script `k4unit.q` is loaded, two configuration variables are defined in namespace `.KU`.
```q
q).KU
       | ::
VERBOSE| 1
DEBUG  | 0
```

The values allowed for `VERBOSE` are

```txt
0  - no logging to console
1  - log filenames
>1 - log tests
```

The values allowed for `DEBUG` are

```txt
0 - trap errors, press on regardless
1 - suspend if errors (except if action=`fail)
```
