# Conclusion



This document has covered a variety of topics concerning
the mechanics and application of the `c.java` interface for kdb+. Of the
workings and examples shown, the most common use case for this interface
will be connecting to a q process, executing queries and functions and
managing any result objects. However, this document has also displayed
the versatile nature of `c.java` as a tool, providing a handful of
solutions to a given problem and able to fulfill server as well as
client functions.

The practical examples should also help demonstrate that tasks required
as part of a standard kdb+ toolset can be handled easily from the
perspective of both Java developers interfacing with kdb+ for the first
time, or kdb+ developers who are required to venture into Java
development, for example, to help complete development of a feed
handler. The benefit of such interfaces is felt keenly through the
common role of these developers in helping to reconcile longstanding
applications with contemporary technologies, often to the benefit of
both.
