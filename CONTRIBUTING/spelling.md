Spelling and grammar
====================


Use American spelling throughout, e.g. `customize`, not `customise`.


Apostrophes
-----------

Do not use apostrophes to form plurals. 

The possessive of a word ending in _s_ is formed with a trailing apostrophe. 
For example:

> Many MPs say that, unlike most MPs’ expenses, this MP’s expenses are questionable.

> People in their 60s know “St James’ Infirmary Blues” was not 1967’s biggest hit, not even one of the 1960s’ biggest hits. 

> 1983’s hit “Oobop Shebam” was her best work in the 1980s, and perhaps the 1980s’ favorite song.


Acronyms, abbreviations, and truncations
---------------------------------------

Set acronyms (pronounceable or not) in upper case without periods, e.g. _IBM_ not _I.B.M._, _HTTP_ not _http_. 

Abbreviations are formed by omitting characters from the middle of a word, truncations by omitting characters from the end. Suffix a truncation with a period; not so with abbreviations. For example

-   Dr Kenneth E. Iverson
-   Mr & Mrs J. Smith 
-   M. le President 


Comma
-----

Use the [serial or ‘Oxford’ comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma) where you can do so without ambiguity. 

The Oxford comma cannot safely be used without thought. 

-   It can resolve ambiguity in a list.
-   It can introduce ambiguity into a list.
-   Some lists have ambiguities that its use or omission do not resolve; such ambiguity may be resolved only by rephrasing.

Commas can have semantic force outside lists, e.g. _Let’s eat, Grandma!_


Hyphens
-------

Hyphenate adjectival phrases, e.g. _real-time systems do things in real time_. 

Above we see that the systems are real-time, not that false time systems are to be avoided.


Ampersands
----------

Use sparingly, not simply as a synonym for _and_, but to mark an association closer than conjunction.

Thus, _Kernigan & Ritchie_ and _Proctor & Gamble_, but _authentication and access control_.

**Exception**: Where an ampersand is part of a label on a UI control, reproduce it faithfully.
