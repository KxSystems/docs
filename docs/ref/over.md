# `over`, `scan`



The keywords `over` and `scan` are covers for the accumulating iterators, [Over and Scan](accumulators.md). 
It is good style to use `over` and `scan` with unary and binary values.

Just as with Over and Scan, `over` and `scan` share the same syntax and perform the same computation; but while `scan` returns the result of each evaluation, `over` returns only the last.

See the [Accumulators](accumulators.md) for a more detailed discussion. 


## Converge

Syntax: `v1 over x`, `over[v1;x]`, `v1 scan x`, `scan[v1;x]`  
Syntax: `(vv)over x`, `over[vv;x]`, `(vv)scan x`, `scan[vv;x]` 

Where 

-   `v1` is a unary [applicable value](../basics/glossary.md#applicable-value)
-   `vv` is a [variadic](../basics/variadic.md) applicable value 

applies the value progressively to `x`, then to `v1[x]` (or `vv[x]`), and so on, until the result matches (within [comparison tolerance](../basics/precision.md#comparison-tolerance)) either

-   the previous result; or
-   `x`.

```q
q)n:("the ";("quick ";"brown ";("fox ";"jumps ";"over ");"the ");("lazy ";"dog."))
q)raze over n
"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
q)(,/)over n
"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
q){x*x} scan .01
0.01 0.0001 1e-08 1e-16 1e-32 1e-64 1e-128 1e-256 0
```

See the [Accumulators](accumulators.md) for more detail, 
and for the related forms Do and While.



## MapReduce, Fold 

Syntax: `v2 over x`, `over[v2;x]`, `v2 scan x`, `scan[v2;x]`  

Where `v2` is a binary [applicable value](../basics/glossary.md#applicable-value), applies `v2` progressively between successive items.

`scan[v2;]` is a [uniform function](../basics/glossary.md#uniform-function) and `over[v2;]` is an [aggregate function](../basics/glossary.md#aggregate-function).

```q
q)(+) scan 1 2 3 4 5
1 3 6 10 15
q)(*) over 1 2 3 4 5
120
```

See the [Accumulators](accumulators.md) for a more detailed discussion. 


## Keywords

Q has keywords for common projections of `scan` and `over`. 
For example, `sums` is `scan[+;]` and `prd` is `over[*;]`.

Good q style prefers these keywords; 
i.e. `prd` rather than `over[*;]` or `*/`.
