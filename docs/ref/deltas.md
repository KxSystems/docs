# `deltas`

_Differences between adjacent list items_





```syntax
deltas x    deltas[x]
```

Where `x` is a numeric or temporal vector, returns differences between consecutive pairs of its items.

```q
q)deltas 1 4 9 16
1 3 5 7
```

In a query to get price movements:

```q
update diff:deltas price by sym from trade
```

With [`signum`](signum.md) to count the number of up/down/same ticks:

```q
q)select count i by signum deltas price from trade
price| x
-----| ----
-1   | 247
0    | 3
1    | 252
```


```txt
domain: b g x h i j e f c s p m d z n u v t
range:  i . i i i j e f . . n i i f n u v t
```


## First predecessor

The predecessor of the first item is 0. 

```q
q)deltas 2000 2005 2007 2012 2020
2000 5 2 5 8
```

It may be more convenient to have 0 as the first item of the result.

```q
q)deltas0:{first[x]-':x}
q)deltas0 2000 2005 2007 2012 2020
0 5 2 5 8
```

!!! warning "Subtract Each Prior"

    The derived function `-':` (Subtract Each Prior) used to define `deltas` is variadic and can be applied as either a unary or a binary.

    However, `deltas` is supported only as a unary function.
    For binary application, use the derived function.
