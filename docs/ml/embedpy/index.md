## Back-incompatible changes

### V0.2-beta -> V1.0

-   Attribute access from embedPy object

    ```q
    q)obj\`ATTRNAME     / old
    q)obj\`:ATTRNAME    / new
    ```

-   embedPy objects can be called directly without explicitly specifying the call return type, the default return type is an embedPy object


### V0.1-beta => V0.2beta in V0.2-beta

V0.2-beta features a number of changes back-incompatible with the previous release, V0.1-beta.

Most notably, the default _type_ used in many operations is now the embedPy type, rather than the foreign type.
