# <i class="fab fa-windows"></i> Installing under Microsoft Windows



Downloading put a file `w64.zip` or `w32.zip` in your downloads folder. 
Extract the files to `C:\`, producing a new folder `C:\q`. 

!!! tip "Installing elsewhere"

    You can install on a different filepath. If you do, in the following instructions simply replace `C:\q` with your filepath.


## <i class="fas fa-check"></i> Confirm q is working

Open a command shell window: type :fa-windows:-r or click the Start button, and type `cmd`.

Launch q by typing 

-   `C:\q\w64\q` (64-bit) 
-   `C:\q\w32\q` (32-bit)

You should see the kdb+ banner.


### 64-bit kdb+

Your q interpreter needs a **license key file**. If it does not find one, it signals a license error and aborts:

```txt
C:\Users\mr.user>C:\q\w64\q
Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601]
Copyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
KDB+ 3.6 2018.06.14 Copyright (C) 1993-2018 Kx Systems

'k4.lic
C:\Users\mr.user>
```

Kdb+ is working. You just need to [install a license](../licensing.md).


### 32-bit kdb+

Your q interpreter needs no license key file. You will see the `q)` prompt. Type `til 6` to see the first 6 integers. Type `\\` to exit q.

## <i class="fas fa-code"></i> Define q as a command

Defining `q` as a command allows you to invoke kdb+ without specifying the path to it.

In the MS-DOS shell:

!!! tip "32-bit kdb+"

    In what follows, substitute `\w32` for `\w64`.

```powershell
C:\Users\mr.user>setx QHOME "C:\q"

SUCCESS: Specified value was saved.

C:\Users\mr.user>setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\q\w64"

SUCCESS: Specified value was saved.

C:\Users\mr.user>exit
```

<!-- ![Setting environment variables](img/install_windows_02.png "Setting environment variables") -->

!!! tip "Installing elsewhere"

    You can install kdb+ where you please. The environment variable `QHOME` (specified above) tells kdb+ where its home folder is. 


This will close your shell session. Open a new shell session and confirm `q` now works as a command.

You’re done. You have completely installed kdb+.
