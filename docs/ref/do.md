# `do`




_Evaluate expression/s some number of times_

```syntax
do[count;e1;e2;e3;…;en]
```

Control construct. Where 

-   `count` is a non-negative integer
-   `e1`, `e2`, … `en` are expressions

the expressions `e1` to `en` are evaluated, in order, `count` times.

The result of `do` is always the [generic null](identity.md#null).

Continued fraction for $\pi$, for 7 steps:

```q
q)r:()
q)t:2*asin 1
q)do[7;r,:q:floor t;t:reciprocal t-q]
q)r
3 7 15 1 292 1 1
```


!!! warning "`do` is not a function but a control construct. It cannot be iterated or projected."


## Name scope

The brackets of the expression list do not create lexical scope.
Name scope within the brackets is the same as outside them.
