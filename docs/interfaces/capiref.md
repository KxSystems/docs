# C API Reference

<i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i> [C client for kdb+](c-client-for-q.md)


## Overview

### K object

The C API provides access to the fundamental data `K` object of kdb+ and methods of manipulating it. The `K` object is a pointer to a `k0` struct, a [tagged union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union), and most of the API manipulates this pointer.

It is defined as
```c
typedef struct k0 *K;
```

More detailed information can be found in C API header file [k.h](https://github.com/KxSystems/kdb/blob/master/c/c/k.h).
The C API defines some types to improve uniformity of the API.

type          | type letter
--------------|:----------:
unsigned char | G     
16-bit int    | H     
32-bit int    | I     
64-bit int    | J     
32-bit float  | E     
64-bit double | F     
char          | C     
char\*        | S     
void          | V     
16-byte array | U     


### Accessing members of the K object

### K object properties for object x

The members which are common to all variant types are `t`, `u`, and `r`. The field `n` is common to all variant types which have a length. These may be dereferenced as usual in the C language: 

accessor | description 
---------|-----------------------------------
`x->t`   | type of K object. (signed char)
`x->u`   | attribute. `0` means no attributes. (`C`)
`x->r`   | reference count. Modify only via `r1(x), r0(x)`. (`I`) 
`x->n`   | number of elements in a list. (`J`)


### Atom accessors for object x

The fields of the variant types which represent an atom (sometimes called a scalar) are:

kdb+ type | accessor      | derived types                     
----------|---------------|-----------------------------------
byte      | `x->g` (`G`)  | boolean, char                     
short     | `x->h` (`H`)  |                                   
int       | `x->i` (`I`)  | month, date, minute, second, time 
long      | `x->j` (`J`)  | timestamp, timespan               
real      | `x->e` (`E`)  |                                   
float     | `x->f` (`F`)  | datetime                          
symbol    | `x->s` (`S`)  | error                             
table     | `x->k` (`K`)  |                                   


### List accessors

To simplify accessing the members for list variant, the following multiple helper macros are provided, to be used as, `kG(x)`, for example.

q type name  | interface list accessor function 
-------------|-----------------------------------------------
mixed list   | `K* kK(x)`
boolean      | `G* kG(x)`
guid         | `U* kU(x)`
byte         | `G* kG(x)`
short        | `H* kH(x)`
int          | `I* kI(x)`
long         | `J* kJ(x)`
real         | `E* kE(x)`
float        | `F* kF(x)`
char         | `C* kC(x)`
symbol       | `S* kS(x)`
timestamp    | `J* kJ(x)`
month        | `I* kI(x)`
date         | `I* kI(x)` (days from 2000.01.01)
datetime     | `F* kF(x)` (days from 2000.01.01)
timespan     | `J* kJ(x)` (nanoseconds) 
minute       | `I* kI(x)`
second       | `I* kI(x)`
time         | `I* kI(x)` (milliseconds)
dictionary   | `kK(x)[0]` for keys and `kK(x)[1]` for values 


## Reference counting

Q uses reference counting to manage object lifetimes. You are said to _own a reference_ if you have created it with [`r1`](#r1-increment-refcount) or received it with an object returned to a call by a C API function. You are responsible for destroying the reference you own with [`r0`](#r0-decrement-refcount) when you are finished with the object.

Ownership of a reference to an object passed as parameter can be taken from you by some of the C API functions. Other C API functions, and all functions from dynamically-linked modules, do not take ownership of references to their parameters; they have to create a new reference to any object they wish to retain or return.

If ownership of a reference has been taken from you, you are no longer responsible for it and should not destroy it. To retain an owned reference to an object, create a new reference to it prior to the call.


## Error handling

C API functions marked as requiring `ee` return 0 on error. You should either propagate the error further by returning 0 or handle it by calling `ee` and handling the resulting object. 

Note that you can only return an error object at a top level from a C function called from q.


## Constants

Q has a rich type system. The type is indicated by a type number and many of these numbers have a constant defined around 0. Positive numbers are used for types which have a length, and the negative of these represent the scalar type. 

For example, `KB` is the type for a vector of booleans, and the negative, `-KB` is for an atom of type boolean.

Some types do not have a constant. For example, `mixed list` has type `0`, and `error` has a type `-128`.

constant | associated type | value
---------|-----------------|------
KB       | boolean         | 1
UU       | guid            | 2
KG       | byte            | 4  
KH       | short           | 5  
KI       | int             | 6  
KJ       | long            | 7  
KE       | real            | 8  
KF       | float           | 9

KP       | timestamp       | 12 
KM       | month           | 13 
KD       | date            | 14

XT       | table           | 98 
XD       | dictionary      | 99 


Some numeric constants are defined and have special meaning – indicating null or positive infinity for that type.

### Joins

function                  | joins             | function                 | joins
--------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------

[`jk`](#jk-join-k-object) | K object to list  | [`jv`](#jv-join-k-lists) | K list to first of same type 

When appending to a list, if the capacity of the list is 
insufficient to accommodate the new data, the list is reallocated with the contents of `x` updated. The new data is always appended, unless the reallocation causes an out-of-memory condition which is then fatal; these functions never return `NULL`. The reallocation of the list will cause the initial list’s reference count to be decremented. The target list passed to join functions should not have an attribute, and the caller should consider that modifications to that target object will be visible to all references to that object unless a reallocation occurred.

## Functions by name 

In the following descriptions, functions are tagged as follows.

tag   | indicates the function
------|---------------------------------
`c.o` | is also available in `c.o`
`own` | takes ownership of a reference
`ee`  | requires `ee` for error handling


### `b9` – serialize

Signature: `K b9(I mode, K x)`  
Tags: `c.o` `ee`

Uses q IPC and  `mode` capabilities level, where `mode` is:

value | effect
:----:|------
-1    | valid for V3.0+ for serializing/deserializing within the same process
0     | unenumerate, block serialization of timespan and timestamp (for working with versions prior to V2.6)
1     | retain enumerations, allow serialization of timespan and timestamp: Useful for passing data between threads
2     | unenumerate, allow serialization of timespan and timestamp
3     | unenumerate, compress, allow serialization of timespan and timestamp


On success, returns a byte-array K object with serialized representation. On error, `NULL` is returned; use `ee` to retrieve error string.


### `d9` – deserialize

Signature: `K d9(K x)`  
Tags: `c.o` `ee`

The byte array `x` is not modified. 

On success, returns deserialized K object. On error, `NULL` is returned; use `ee` to retrieve the error string.



### `dj` – date to number

Signature: `I dj(I date)`  
Tags: `c.o`

Converts a q date to a `yyyymmdd` integer.

<i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i> 
[`ymd` – numbers to date](#ymd-numbers-to-date)


### `dl` – dynamic link

Signature: `K dl(V* f, I n)`

Function takes a C function that would take _n_ K objects as arguments and returns a K object. Shared library only.

Returns a q function. 


### `dot` – apply

Signature: `K dot(K x, K y)`  
Tags: `ee`

The same as the q function [Apply](../ref/apply.md), i.e. `.[x;y]`. Shared library only.

On success, returns a K object with the result of the `.` application. On error, `NULL` is returned. See `ee` for result-handling example.



### `ee` – error string

Signature: `K ee(K)`  
Tags: `c.o` 

Capture (and reset) error string into usual error object, e.g.
```c
K x=ee(dot(a,b));if(xt==-128)printf("error %s\n", x->s);
```

Since V3.5 2017.02.16, V3.4 2017.03.13

!!! tip "Handling errors"

    If a function returns type K and has the option to return NULL, the user should wrap the call with `ee`, and check for the error result, also considering that the error string pointer (`x->s`) may also be NULL. e.g.

    ```c
    ​K x=ee(dot(a,b));if(xt==-128)printf("error %s\n", x->s?x->s:"");
    ```

    Otherwise the error status within the interpreter may still set set, resulting in the error being signalled incorrectly elsewhere in kdb+.

    Calling `ee(…)` has the side effect of clearing the interpreter’s error status for the NULL result path.


### `ja` – join value

Signature: `K ja(K* x, V*)`  
Tags: `c.o` 

Appends a raw value to a list. 
`x` points to a K object, which may be reallocated during the function.
The contents of `x`, i.e. `*x`, will be updated in case of reallocation. 

Returns a pointer to the (potentially reallocated) K object.


### `jk` – join K object

Signature: `K jk(K* x, K y)`  
Tags: `c.o` `own`

Appends another K object to a mixed list. Takes ownership of a reference to its argument `y`. 

Returns a pointer to the (potentially reallocated) K object.


### `js` – join string

Signature: `K js(K* x, S s)`  
Tags: `c.o` 

Appends an interned string `s` to a symbol list. 

Returns a pointer to the (potentially reallocated) K object.


### `jv` – join K lists

Signature: `K jv(K* x, K y)`  
Tags: `c.o` 

Append a K list `y` to K list `x`. 

Returns a pointer to the (potentially reallocated) K object.


### `k` – evaluate

<!-- Signature: `K k(I handle, const S s, …)__attribute__((sentinel))` -->
Signature: `K k(I handle, const S s, …)`  
Tags: `own`

Evaluates `s`. 
Optional parameters are either local (shared library only) or remote. 
The last argument must be `NULL`.

Takes ownership of references to its arguments.

Behavior depends on the value of `handle`.

-    `handle>0`, sends sync message to handle, to evaluate a string or function with parameters, and then blocks until a message of any type is received on handle. It can return `NULL` (indicating a network error) or a pointer to a K object. `k(handle,(S)NULL)` does not send a message, and blocks until a message of any type is received on handle.
    If that object has type -128, it indicates an error, accessible as a null-terminated string in `r->s`. When you have finished using this object, it should be freed by calling `r0(r)`.

-    `handle<0`, this is for async messaging, and the return value can be either 0 (network error) or non-zero (success). This result should _not_ be passed to `r0`.

<!-- -   `handle=0`, this function is equivalent of [_apply_](../ref/unclassified/#apply) (`.`). -->
-   `handle==0` is valid only for a plugin, and executes against the kdb+ process in which it is loaded. 

See more on [message types](java-client-for-q.md#message-types). Note that a `k` call will block until a message is sent/received (`handle!=0`) or evaluated (`handle=0`).




### `ka` – create atom

Signature: `K ka(I t)`  
Tags: `c.o` 

Creates an atom of type `t`.


### `kb` – create boolean

Signature: `K kb(I)`  
Tags: `c.o` 



### `kc` – create char

Signature: `K kc(I)`  
Tags: `c.o` 

Null: `kc(" ")`


### `kclose` – disconnect

Signature: `V kclose(I)` 

With the release of `c.o` with V2.6, `c.o` now tracks the connection type (pre V2.6, or V2.6+). Hence, to close the connection, you must call `kclose` (instead of `close` or `closeSocket`): this will clean up the connection tracking and close the socket.

### `sd1` – set function on loop

Signature: `K sd1(I d, f)`

Put the function `K f(I d){…}` on the q main event loop given a socket `d`. 

If `d` is negative, the socket is switched to non-blocking. 

The function `f` should return `NULL` or a pointer to a K object, and its reference count will be decremented.
(It is the return value of `f` that will be `r0`’d – and only if not null.)

Shared library only.

On success, returns int K object containing `d`. On error, `NULL` is returned, `d` is closed.


### `setm` – toggle symbol lock

A dictionary of settings similar to [`-26!x`](../basics/internal.md#-26x-ssl), or an error if SSL initialisation failed.

```c
extern I khpunc(S hostname,I port,S usernamepassword,I timeout,I capability);
int handle=khpunc("remote host",5000,"user:password",timeout,2);
extern K sslInfo(K x); 
if(handle==-3){
    K x=ee(sslInfo((K)0));
    printf("Init error %s\n",xt==-128?x->s:"unknown");
    r0(x);
}
```

Returns null if there was an error initializing the OpenSSL lib.


### `vak`, `vaknk` – va_list versions of k, knk

Signature: `K vak(I,const S,va_list)`  
Signature: `K vaknk(I,va_list)`

where `va_list` is as defined in 
[`stdarg.h`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stdarg.h), 
included by `k.h`

These are `va_list` versions of the `K k(I,const S,…)` and `K knk(I,…)` functions, useful for writing variadic utility functions that can forward the K objects.
