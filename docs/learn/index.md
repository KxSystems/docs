# Get started 


Kdb+ is a database. While you can use it through interfaces such as ODBC, its power and performance are best accessed through its own language, q.

Q is a general-purpose programming language. You can write programs for anything in q. 

You do not need prior programming experience to learn q. 
If you have some experience with mathematics, functional programming or SQL, you will find much that is familiar.

## <i class="fas fa-database"></i> A brief introduction

[First steps](brief-introduction.md)

: Run your first query.

[In-memory queries](brief-introduction.md#in-memory-queries)

: Build a more complex dataset in memory and perform some queries and joins on it. The dataset is from an imaginary desktop PC monitoring and helpdesk support system.

[On-disk queries](brief-introduction.md#on-disk-queries)

: Download a set of scripts to build and run queries against a large on-disk database. The dataset is from an imaginary smart-meter network. It includes a basic HTML5 Business Intelligence tool which queries the database directly.

    > Roughly speaking, kdb+ is what happens when q tables are persisted and then mapped back into memory for operations.
