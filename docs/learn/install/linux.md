# <i class="fab fa-linux"></i> Installing under Linux



Open a Bash session (eg LXTerminal) in your home folder and `cd` to the folder where you downloaded your ZIP file. Unzip the archive. A new folder `q` will appear there. Copy it to your home folder and `cd` there.

```bash
$ cd ~/Downloads
~/Downloads$ unzip linux-x86.zip
Archive:  linux-x86.zip
  inflating: q/README.txt
  inflating: q/l32/q
  inflating: q/q.q
  inflating: q/q.k
  inflating: q/s.k
  inflating: q/trade.q
  inflating: q/sp.q
~/Downloads$ cp -r q ~/.
~/Downloads$ cd
$
```

<!-- ![cd ~/Downloads unzip linux-x86.zip cp -r q ~/. cd ~](img/install_linux_01.png "cd ~/Downloads unzip linux-x86.zip cp -r q ~/. cd ~") -->


## 64-bit or 32-bit?

Use the `uname` command to determine whether your machine is using the 32-bit or 64-bit Linux distribution.
```bash
$ uname -m
i686
```
<!-- ![Determining the distribution bit size](img/install_linux_02.png "Determining the distribution bit size") -->

If the result is `i686` or `i386` or similar, you are running a **32-bit** Linux distribution. If the result is `x86_64`, you are running a **64-bit** Linux distribution.

If you are installing 32-bit kdb+ on a 32-bit Linux distribution, proceed to [Launch (minimum install)](#minimum-install-and-launch).

But if you are installing 32-bit kdb+ on a 64-bit Linux distribution, you will need a 32-bit library. Use your usual package manager to install i686 or i386: for example:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libc6-i386
```

## <i class="fas fa-rocket"></i> Minimum install and launch

Confirm that kdb+ runs. In your home folder, type `q/l32/q`
to see the kdb+ banner and the `q)` prompt. 
Type `til 6` to see the first six integers. Type `\\` to return to Linux.

You have completed the minimum installation. We recommend continuing with _Complete install and launch_.


## Complete install and launch

The minimum installation can be improved in two important ways. We strongly recommend them.

* Call kdb+ within the `rlwrap` command, which will allow you to call back and edit previous lines
* Define `q` as a command alias, allowing you to invoke kdb+ without specifying the path to it


### <i class="fas fa-plug"></i> Install Rlwrap

<!-- Exit kdb+ to return to the Bash prompt and your home folder.  -->
Ask for Rlwrap’s version number. If you see one, Rlwrap is already installed

```bash
$ rlwrap -v
rlwrap 0.42
$
```

<!-- ![Exit q and see if Rlwrap is installed](img/install_linux_04.png "Exit q and see if Rlwrap is installed") -->

If Rlwrap is already installed you can go on to the next step.

Otherwise, you will be told `rlwrap: command not found`. Install Rlwrap using your package manager.


### <i class="fas fa-code"></i> Edit your profile

In the File Manager, find `.bashrc` in your home folder.

![Bash profile](img/install_linux_05.png "Bash profile")

Open it with a text editor, append the following line

```bash
alias q='QHOME=~/q rlwrap -r ~/q/l32/q'
```
and save it. 
Start a new Bash session, or tell Bash to use the revised profile:

```bash
$ source .bashrc
```

<!-- ![source .bashrc](img/install_linux_06.png "source .bashrc") -->

!!! tip "Installing elsewhere"

    You can install kdb+ where you please. The environment variables `QHOME` (specified above) and `QLIC` tell kdb+ [where to find its files](../licensing.md). 


## <i class="fas fa-check"></i> Confirm successful installation

From your home folder, launch kdb+, type an expression and recall it using the up-arrow key. Exit kdb+.

## <i class="fas fa-certificate"></i> Install a license key file

64-bit kdb+ requires a license key file.
[Obtain and install](../licensing.md) one.

You’re done. You have completely installed kdb+. 


## <i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i> What’s next?

[Learn the q programming language](../index.md#learn-q), look through the [reference card](../../ref/index.md), or see in the [Knowledge Base](../../kb/index.md)  what you can do with kdb+.
