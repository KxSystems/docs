This section describes the outputs produced following model selection and optimization. All outputs are contained in an `outputs` directory within the `automl` repository.

In its default configuration, the pipeline returns:

-   visualizations: data split, target distribution, feature impact, confusion matrix (classification only) and regression analysis (regression only) plots
-   best model saved as a binary, `.h5` or `.pt` file depending on the type of model returned
-   configuration file outlining the procedure carried out for a run which can be used in re-running a pipeline
-   report outlining the steps taken and results achieved at each step of a run.

The outputs are in subfolders `images`, `models`, `config`, and `reports` respectively, in a directory named as the date and time of the run. The folder structure for each unique run is as follows: `automl/outputs/dateTimeModels/date/run_time/...`.

## Visualizations

A number of visualizations are produced within the pipeline and are saved to disk (in the default setting of AutoML) to be used within report generation, or for posterity. The specific images produced are detailed below and depend on the problem type of the current run.

### Data split

Every run generates an image showing the specific split applied to the data. 
In the default case depicted below, 20% of the data is used as the testing set, then 20% of the remaining data is used as a holdout set, wth the rest of the data used as the training set.

### Target distribution

A target distribution plot it generated for both classification and regression tasks. For classification, the plot simply shows the split between the classes within the target vector. While in the regression case, the target values are separated into 10 bins, as demonstrated in the example below.

### Feature impact

The feature-impact plot identifies the features with the highest impact on predicting the outcomes of a model. Within the framework, the impact of a single feature column is determined by shuffling the values in that column and running the best model again with this new, scrambled feature.

It should be expected that if a feature is an important contributor to the output of a model, then scrambling or shuffling that feature will cause the model to perform poorly due to removal of signal for a model. Conversely, if the model performs better, or results do  not change, it could be inferred that the feature is not relevant for model training.

A score is produced by the model for each shuffled column, with all scores ordered and scaled using `.ml.minMaxScaler.fit` contained within the ML Toolkit. An example plot is shown below for a table containing four features, using a Gradient Boosting Regressor.

### Confusion matrix

A confusion matrix shows how well the predictions produced by a model predict the actual class. This gives you a visual representation of the success or otherwise of the model.

### Regression analysis

For regression problems, plotting true vs predicted targets and their residuals values show how well your model performed, by mapping predicted values to actual values and plotting the difference as a residual plot.

## Configuration

Once the pipeline has been completed, a configuration dictionary is saved as a binary file. 

This file is used for running on new data and can be used for oversight where configuration data is important for regulation.

-   `tts` is a dictionary with feature and target data split into training/testing sets

returns dictionary of consolidated parameters to be used to generate reports/graphs.


## `.automl.saveGraph.node.function`

_Save all the graphs required for report generation_

```syntax
.automl.saveGraph.node.function params
```
