# :fontawesome-solid-laptop-code: Interactive development environments


When q runs it displays a console where you enter expressions and see them evaluated. 

```q
KDB+ 4.0 2020.05.20 Copyright (C) 1993-2020 Kx Systems
m64/ 12()core 65536MB sjt mackenzie.local 127.0.0.1 ..

q)til 6

```

This is all you need to follow the tutorials, and if you just want to learn a little about q, it is easiest to work in the console.

As you become more familiar with q, you may prefer to work in an interactive development environment.
