# <i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i> FRESH: a feature-extraction and feature-significance toolkit



<i class="fab fa-github"></i>
[KxSystems/ml](https://github.com/kxsystems/ml)

Feature extraction and selection are vital components of many machine learning pipelines. Here we outline an implementation of the [FRESH](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.07717v3.pdf) (FeatuRe Extraction and Scalable Hypothesis testing) algorithm.

Feature extraction is the process of building derived, aggregate features from a time series dataset. The features created are designed to characterize the underlying time series in a way that is easier to interpret and often provides a more suitable input to machine learning algorithms.

Following feature extraction, statistical significance tests between feature and target vectors can be applied. This allows selection of only those features with relevance (in the form of a p-value) as defined by the user.

Feature selection can improve the accuracy of a machine learning algorithm by

-  Simplifying the models used.
-  Shortening the training time needed.
-  Mitigating the curse of dimensionality.
-  Reducing variance in the dataset to reduce overfitting.

Notebooks showing examples of the FRESH algorithm used in different applications can be found at

## Loading

Load the FRESH library in isolation from the utilities section of the toolkit using

```q
q)\l ml/ml.q
q).ml.loadfile`:fresh/init.q
```

## Data formatting

Data passed to the feature extraction procedure should contain an identifying (id) column, which groups the time-series into subsets from which features can be extracted. The id column can be inherent to the data or derived for a specific use-case (e.g. applying a sliding window onto the dataset).

Null values in the data should be replaced with derived values most appropriate to the column.

The feature extraction procedure supports columns of boolean, integer and floating-point types. Other datatypes should not be passed to the extraction procedure.

In particular, data should not contain text (strings or symbols), other than within the id column. If a text-based feature is thought to be important, one-hot, frequency or lexigraphical encoding can be used to convert the symbolic data to appropriate numerical values.

!!! note

    A range of formatting functions (e.g. null-filling and one-hot encoding) are supplied in the [preprocessing section](utilities/preproc.md) of the toolkit.

## Calculated features

Feature extraction functions are defined in the script `fresh.q` and found within the `.ml.fresh.feat` namespace.

## Feature extraction

Feature extraction involves applying a set of aggregations to subsets of the initial input data, with the goal of obtaining information that is more informative to the prediction of the target vector than the raw time series. 

The `.ml.fresh.createfeatures` function applies a set of aggregation functions to derive features. There are 57 such functions callable within the `.ml.fresh.feat` namespace, although users may select a subset of these based on requirement.

### `.ml.fresh.createfeatures`

_Applies functions to subsets of initial data to create features_

Syntax: `.ml.fresh.createfeatures[t;aggs;cnames;ptab]`

Where

-   `t` is the input data in the form of a simple table.
-   `aggs` is the id column name (syms).
-   `cnames` are the column names (syms) on which extracted features will be calculated (these columns should contain only numerical values).
-   `ptab` is a table containing the functions and parameters to be applied to the `cnames` columns. This should be a modified version of `.ml.fresh.params`

This returns a table keyed by id column and containing the features extracted from the subset of the data identified by the `id` column.

!!!note
	Modifications to the file `hyperparam.txt` within the FRESH folder allows for fine tuning to the number and variety of calculations to be made. Users can create their own features by defining a function within the `.ml.fresh.feat` namespace and, if necessary, providing relevant hyperparameters in .ml.fresh.params.
!!!warning
	The operating principal of this function has changed relative to that in versions `0.1.x`. In the previous version parameter #4 had been a dictionary denoting the functions to be applied to the table. This worked well for producing features from functions that only took the data as input (using `.ml.fresh.getsingleinputfeatures`). To account for multi-parameter functions the structure outlined above has been used as it provides more versatility to function application.

## Feature significance

Statistical significance tests can be applied to the derived features to determine how useful each feature is in predicting a target vector. The specific significance test applied, depends on the characteristics of the feature and target. The following table outlines the test applied in each case.

feature type       | target type       | significance test 
:------------------|:------------------|:------------------
Binary             | Real              | Kolmogorov-Smirnov
Binary             | Binary            | Fisher-Exact      
Real               | Real              | Kendall Tau-b     
Real               | Binary            | Kolmogorov-Smirnov

Each test returns a p-value, which can then be passed to a selection procedure chosen by the user. The feature selection procedures available at present are as follows;

1. The Benjamini-Hochberg-Yekutieli (BHY) procedure: determines if the feature meets a defined False Discovery Rate (FDR) level. The recommended input is 5% (0.05).
2. K-best features: choose the K features which have the lowest p-values and thus have been determined to be the most important features to allow us to predict the target vector.
3. Percentile based selection: set a percentile threshold for p-values below which features are selected.

Each of these procedures can be implemented by modifying parameter input to the following function;

### `.ml.fresh.significantfeatures`

_Return statistically significant features based on defined selection procedure_

Syntax: `.ml.fresh.significantfeatures[t;tgt;f]`

Where

-   `t` is the value side of a table of created features
-   `tgt` is a list of targets corresponding to the rows of table `t` 
-   `f` is a projection with example syntax `.ml.fresh.ksigfeat 10`

returns a list of features deemed statistically significant as deemed by the user defined procedure within parameter `f`.
