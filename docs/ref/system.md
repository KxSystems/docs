# :fontawesome-solid-bullhorn: `system`




_Execute a system command_

```syntax
system x     system[x]
```

Where `x` is a string representing a system command and any parameters to it, executes the command and returns the result as a list of character vectors. 

!!! note "The system command does not include a leading `\`."

```q
q)\l sp.q
â€¦
q)\a                     / tables in namespace
`p`s`sp
q)count \a               / \ must be the first character
'\
q)system "a"             / same command called with system
`p`s`sp
q)count system "a"       / this returns a result
3
```

As with `\`, if the argument is not a q command, it is executed in the shell:

```q
q)system "pwd"
"/home/guest/q"
```

??? warning "Binary output"

	The result is expected to be text, and is captured into a list of character vectors. 
	As part of this capture, line feeds and associated carriage returns are removed. 
	
	This transformation makes it impractical to capture binary data from the result of the system call. 
	Redirecting the output to a 
	[file](https://code.kx.com/q/ref/read1/) or 
	[fifo](https://code.kx.com/q/kb/named-pipes/) for explicit ingestion may be appropriate in such cases.


## :fontawesome-solid-database: Directing output to a file

When redirecting output to a file, for efficiency purposes, avoiding using `>tmpout` needlessly; append a semi-colon to the command.

```q
q)system"cat x"
```

is essentially the same as the shell command

```bash
cat x > tmpout
```

as kdb+ tries to capture the output.
So if you do

```q
system"cat x > y"
```

under the covers that looks like

```bash
cat x > y > tmpout
```

Not good. So if you add the semicolon

```q
system"cat x > y;"
```

the shell interpreter considers it as two statements

```bash
cat x > y; > tmpout
```

## :fontawesome-solid-exclamation-triangle: Capture stderr output

You cannot capture the stderr output from the system call directly, but a workaround is

```q
/ force capture to a file, and cat the file
q)system"ls egg > file 2>&1;cat file"
"ls: egg: No such file or directory"        
/ try and fails to capture the text
q)@[system;"ls egg";{0N!"error - ",x;}]
ls: egg: No such file or directory
"error - os"
```
