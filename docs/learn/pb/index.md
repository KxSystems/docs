# Q by Puzzles

The q language favors terse code that exploits the iteration implicit in the primitives. 

_Accustomed to analyze problems into loops, tests, and cases?_
The shift to array thinking can be a challenge. 
Play is an excellent way to explore new techniques. 

Q by Puzzles studies array-oriented programming techniques in the context of simple problems.
They explore distinctive language features in some depth.

Use them to train your brain for q.
