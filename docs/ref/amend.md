# `.` `@` Amend, Amend At



_Modify one or more items in a list._

syntax           | rank | semantics
-----------------|:----:|----------------------------------------
`.[d; i; v; my]` | 4    | amend items at depth with value `v` rank ≥2
`@[d; i; v; my]` | 4    | amend items at depth 1 with value `v` rank ≥2
`.[d; i; u]`     | 3    | amend items at depth with unary value `u`
`@[d; i; u]`     | 3    | amend items at depth 1  with unary value `u`
`.[d; i; :; y]`  | 4    | replace items at depth 
`@[d; i; :; y]`  | 4    | replace items at depth 1

Where 

-   `d` is a list or a handle to a list
-   `i` is a list of items in the domain of `d`
-   `v` is a value of rank $n$, and `my` an atom, or list conformable to `i`, of rank $n-1$ with items in the right domain/s of `m`
-   `u` is a unary value
-   `y` is an atom or list conformable to `i`

if `d` is a 

-   **variable**, returns a copy of it with the items at `i` modified
-   **handle**, modifies the items of its reference at `i`, and returns the handle


## Selection

The items in `d` that are to be replaced are selected by `i` just as in [**Apply**](apply.md), i.e. `d . i` and `d@i`. 

Call the items selected by `d . i` or `d@i` the _selection_.


### Amend Entire

If `d` is an **atom** other than a dictionary or a handle and `i` is an empty list, then all of `d` is modified.

If `d` is a **list** and `i` is **nil**, then all of `d` is amended, but one item at a time, as if `i` were `key d`. ==FIXME Confirm. Example==

In the case of a non-empty list `i`, the value `u` or `v` is evaluated once for every path generated from `i`, just as the above definition indicates. 

However, if the index `i` is the empty list, i.e. `()`, then Amend is Amend Entire. That is, the entire value in `d` is replaced, in the quaternary `.[d;();v;y]` with `v[d;y]`, or in `.[d;();:;y]` with `y`, as in `d:y`, and in the ternary `.[d;();u]` with `u[d]`. 

```q
.[2 3; (); ,; 4 5 6]
2 3 4 5 6
```


## Amend At

Exactly as for [Apply At](apply.md#apply-at-index-ats), `@[d;i;…` is everywhere [syntactic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar) for `.[d;enlist i;…`.

In the general case of a one-item list `i`

-   `.[d;i;u;y]` is identical to `@[d;first i;u;y]`
-   `.[d;i;u]` is identical to `@[d;first i;u]`

Definitions and examples that follow are written for `.` – adapt them for `@`. 



## Modification

In the quaternary, each item in the selection is replaced by the result of evaluating `v` on itself as the left argument and the corresponding item in `y` as the right argument.

In the Replace form (with the colon as third argument) each item in the selection is replaced by the corresponding item in `y`. 

!!! note "Replacement"

    The colon `:` acts here as syntactic sugar for the the function `{[x;y] y}` or, more simply, `{y}`.

In the ternary, each item in the selection is replaced by the result of evaluating `u` on it. 

The new value/s of `d . i` are determined by the third argument, and whether `i` denotes a single path:

3rd argument | single path       | general
:-----------:|-------------------|--------------------
`:`          | `y`               | `y . i`
`u`          | `u[d . i]`        | `u'[d . i]`
`v`          | `v[d . i; y . i]` | `v'[d . i; y . i]`


==FIXME Replace `'` in definition with recursion?==


## Examples


### Single path

If `i` is a non-negative integer vector then the selection is a single item at depth `count i` in `d`.

```q
q)(5 2.14; "abc") . 1 2              / Index at depth 2
"c"
q).[(5 2.14; "abc"); 1 2; :; "x"]    / replace at depth 2 
5 2.14
"abx"
```


### Cross sections

Where the items of `i` are non-negative integer vectors, they define a cross section.
The result can be understood as a series of single-path amends.

```q
q)d
(1 2 3;4 5 6 7)
(8 9;10;11 12)
(13 14;15 16 17 18;19 20)
q)i:(2 0; 0 1 0)
q)y:(100 200 300; 400 500 600)
q)r:.[d; i; ,; y]
```

The following display of `d` adjacent to `r` provides easy comparison:

```q
q)d                              q)r
(1 2 3;4 5 6 7)                  (1 2 3 400 600;4 5 6 7 500)
(8 9;10;11 12)                   (8 9;10;11 12)
(13 14;15 16 17 18;19 20)        (13 14 100 300;15 16 17 18 200;19 20)
```

The shape of `y` is `2 3`, the same shape as the cross-section selected by `d . i`. The `(j;k)`th item of `y` corresponds to the path `(i[0;j];i[1;k])`. The first single-path Amend is equivalent to:

```q
d: .[d; (i . 0 0; i . 1 0); ,; y . 0 0]
```

(since the amends are being done individually, and the assignment serves to capture the individual results as we go), or:

```q
d: .[d; 2 0; ,; 100]
```

and item `d . 2 0` becomes `13 14,100`, or `13 14 100`. 
The next single-path Amend is:

```q
d: .[d; (i . 0 0; i . 1 1); ,; y . 0 1]
```

or

```q
d: .[d; 2 1; ,; 200]
```

and item `d . 2 1` becomes `15 16 17 18 200`. 

Continuing in this manner:

-   item `d . 2 0` becomes `13 14 100 300`, modifying the previously modified value `13 14 100`
-   item `d . 0 0` becomes `1 2 3 400`
-   item `d . 0 1` becomes `4 5 6 7 500`
-   item `d . 0 0` becomes `1 2 3 400 600`, modifying the previously modified value `1 2 3 400`


### Replacement

```q
d:((1 2 3; 4 5 6 7)
   (8 9; 10; 11 12)
   (13 14; 15 16 17 18; 19 20))
i:(2 0; 0 1 0)
y:(100 200 300; 400 500 600)
r:.[d; i; :; y]
```

The following display of `d` next to `r` provides easy comparison.

```q
q)d                           q)r
(1 2 3;4 5 6 7)               600 500             / replaced twice; once
(8 9;10;11 12)                (8 9;10;11 12)
(13 14;15 16 17 18;19 20)     (300;200;19 20)     / replaced twice; once; not
```

Note multiple replacements of some items-at-depth in `d`, corresponding to the multiple updates in the earlier example.


## Unary value

The ternary replaces the selection with the results of applying `u` to them.

```q
q)d
(1 2 3;4 5 6 7)
(8 9;10;11 12)
(13 14;15 16 17 18;19 20)
q)i
2 0
0 1 0
q)y
100 200 300
400 500 600
q)r:.[d; i; neg]
```

The following display of `d` next to `r` provides easy comparison.

```q
q)d                            q)r
(1 2 3;4 5 6 7)                (1 2 3;-4 -5 -6 -7)
(8 9;10;11 12)                 (8 9;10;11 12)
(13 14;15 16 17 18;19 20)      (13 14;-15 -16 -17 -18;19 20)
```

Note multiple applications of `neg` to some items-at-depth in `d`, corresponding to the multiple updates in the first example.


## The general case

In general, `i` can be

-   an atom that is a valid index of `d`, e.g. one of `key d`
-   a list representing paths to items at depth `count i` in `d`

The function proceeds recursively through `i[0]` and `y` as if they were the arguments of a binary atomic function, except that when arriving at an atom in `i[0]`, that value is retained as the first item in a path and the recursion continues on with `i[1]` and the item-at-depth in `y` that had been arrived at the same time as the atom in `i[0]`. 

And so on, until arriving at an atom in the last item of `i`. At that point a path `p` into `d` has been created and the item at depth `count i` selected by `p`, namely `d . p`, is replaced by `m[d . p;z]` for binary `m`, or `u[d . p]` for unary `u`, where `z` is the item-at-depth in `y` that had been arrived at the same time as the atom in the last item of `i`.

The general case for binary `v` can be defined recursively by partitioning the index list into its first item and the rest:

```q
Amend:{[d;F;R;v;y] 
  $[ nil ~ F; Amend[d; key d; R; v; y];
    0 = count R; @[d; F; v; y];
        @ F; Amend[d @ F; first R; 1_R; v; y];
             Amend[;; R;;]/[d; F; v; y]}
```

==FIXME Revise definition: Atom; nil==

Note the application of [Over](FIXME) to Amend, which requires that whenever `F` is not an atom, either `y` is an atom or `count F` equals `count y`. Over is used to accumulate all changes in the first argument `d`.


## Accumulate

Cases of Amend with a value `u` or `v` are sometimes called Accumulate because the new items-at-depth are computed in terms of the old, as in `.[x; 2 6; +; 1]`, where item 6 of item 2 is incremented by 1.


## Errors

error  | cause
-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------
domain | `d` is a symbol atom but not a handle
index  | a path in `i` is not a valid path of `d`
length | `i` and `y` are not conformable 
type   | an atom of `i` is not an integer, symbol or nil


## Functional Amend

==Integrate following with preceding!==

Syntax: `@[x;i;f]`  
Syntax: `@[x;i;f;a]`  
Syntax: `@[x;i;f;v]`

Where

- `x` is a list (or file symbol, see Tip)
- `i` is an int vector of indexes of `x`
- `f` is a function
- `a` is an atom in the domain of the second argument of `f`
- `v` is a vector in the domain of the second argument of `f`

returns `x` with its values at indexes `i` changed.

For `ind` in `til count i`, `x[i ind]` becomes

```txt
expression   x[i ind]
-----------------------------
@[x;i;f]     f[x i ind] 
@[x;i;f;a]   f[x i ind][a]
@[x;i;f;v]   f[x i ind][v ind]
```

```q
q)d:("quick";"";"brown";"fox")
q)@[d;where"b"$count each d;,[;"..."]] / unary f
"quick..."
""
"brown..."
"fox..."
q)d:((1 2 3;4 5 6 7);(8 9;10;11 12);(13 14;15 16 17 18;19 20))
q)@[d;1 1 1;+;3] / binary f
((1 2 3;4 5 6 7);(17 18;19;20 21);(13 14;15 16 17 18;19 20))
```

Functions of rank higher than 2 can be applied by enlisting their arguments and using [Apply](apply.md).

!!! warning "Projections"

    For a general list `x`, omitting `a` or `v` when `f` is binary returns projections at the indexes `i`:

    <pre><code class="language-q">
    q)0N!@[("ssd";"bsd");0;+];
    (+["ssd"];"bsd")
    </code></pre>

!!! tip "Do it on disk"

    Since V3.4 certain vectors can be updated directly on disk without the need to fully rewrite the file. Such vectors must have no attribute, be of a mappable type, not nested, and not compressed. e.g.

    <pre><code class="language-q">
    q)\`:data set til 20;
    q)@[\`:data;3 6 8;:;100 200 300]; 
    q)get\`:data 
    0 1 2 100 4 5 200 7 300 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
    </code></pre>
