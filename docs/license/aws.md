    enforceable by any third party or person who is not a party to
    this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt this Agreement is
    between you and Kx and is entirely separate to any terms you may
    have agreed to within AWS or AWS Marketplace. This Agreement
    shall be governed by California law, except as to copyright
    matters covered by Federal law. This Agreement is deemed entered
    into at Palo Alto, California by both parties. Any dispute
    related to this Agreement shall be resolved only in the
    California State Courts or Federal Courts located in Santa Clara
    County, California, and User hereby waives any objections to

    declared unenforceable in any jurisdiction, then such provision
    shall be deemed to be severed from this Agreement and shall not
    affect the remainder hereof. Furthermore, with respect to a
    violation by you of the provisions of sections 2 and 5 and/or
    payment obligations relating to this Agreement, Kx will have the
    right at its discretion to seek remedies in courts within any
    applicable territory. User and the organisation which you
    represent and have bound to the terms of this Agreement shall be
    jointly and severally liable for User’s obligations under this
    Agreement. This Agreement supersedes all prior or
    contemporaneous representations, negotiations, or other
    communications between the parties relating to the subject
    matter of this Agreement. It replaces and supersedes any
    previous oral or written agreements, in relation to this
    Agreement including any previous versions of the Agreement
    accessed by the User or any representative from the organisation
    which you have bound under this Agreement, and any
    understandings or other communications between the parties in
    connection with this Agreement. The waiver by either party of a
    breach or right under this Agreement will not constitute a
    waiver of any other or subsequent breach or right.
    Non-performance of either party shall be excused to the extent
    that performance is rendered impossible by strike, fire, flood,
    governmental acts, order or restrictions, failure of suppliers,
    or any other reason where failure to perform is beyond the
    control and not caused by the negligence of the non-performing
    party. User agrees that the Kdb+ Software is “commercial
    computer software” and/or “commercial computer software
    documentation” pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202 and FAR Section
    12.212, as applicable, and any use, modification, reproduction,
    release, performance, display, or disclosure of the Kdb+
    Software by a U.S. government agency shall be prohibited except
    as expressly permitted by this Agreement, which terms shall
    govern.
