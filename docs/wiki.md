# The Kx wiki



The Kx wiki was the primary documentation for q and kdb+ until January 2017.

The content, which runs on [Mediawiki](http://mediawiki.org), 
has now been [archived on GitHub](https://github.com/kxsystems/wiki).

Inquiries to <librarian@kx.com>. 


## Search engines

If you arrived here from a search engine link, that was deliberate.
Without actually taking the wiki down, weâ€™re discouraging search engines from returning out-of-date wiki pages in their results, 

We apologize for the inconvenience. 
We trust the search engines will catch up soon.


## Still spinning

You can visit a frozen copy of [the archived wiki](https://code.kx.com/oldwiki).

If you still prefer using the wiki to the current documentation, the [Librarian](mailto:librarian@kx.com) would be grateful for a note about why that is.
