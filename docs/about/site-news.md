## V2

<small>2019.03.07</small>

Version 2 of this site has

-   extensive revision of the Reference, including 
-   a completely new description of the _iterators_ (formerly _adverbs_), completing the terminology review that started in 2016
-   simplified URLs for Reference articles
-   a new version, [Iterators](../wp/iterators/index.md) of the 2013 white paper “Efficient use of adverbs”
-   HTTP requests redirected to HTTPS 
-   An updated version of <i class="fab fa-github"></i> [`help.q`](https://github.com/kxsystems/help)

The previous version of the site will remain for some time at its former URL <https://code.kx.com/q>, so bookmarks to it will continue to work. 

The Kx wiki, frozen in 2016, has been retired to <https://code.kx.com/oldwiki>.

## <i class="fas fa-search"></i> Custom search engine

<small>2018.01.14</small>

We have replaced the native MkDocs client-side search engine with a custom search engine written in q. 

The large majority of visits to this site are from laptops and desktops, so the new search engine displays results as a page, rather than a popup list. 

The engine is still being developed. 
Please send your comments, suggestions and requests to librarian@kx.com.

We have revised the terms in which we talk about q, to align them with common usage. You will find _operators_ and _unary_ and _binary_ _functions_ applied _prefix_, _infix_ and _postfix_. Q’s _adverbs_ still need their distinctive name, but you will no longer find references to _verbs_, _monads_ or _dyads_. 

We also now distinguish consistently between glyphs and what they denote. In some cases we’ve coined new names to distinguish what was previously conflated. So, for example, `/` denotes Over, Converge, Do, and While. 

Overloads such as these are distinguished in use by syntax and arguments. Every operator, function and adverb now has its syntax and arguments consistently and clearly described.
