Distinguish _endogenous_ and _exogenous_ variables.

Endogenous

: The values of the variable are determined by the model, i.e. form the basis for predicting a ‘target’ variable

Exogenous

: Any variable whose value is determined outside of the model and which may impose an effect on the endogenous variable, i.e. if there is a national holiday this may affect the endogenous variable, but is completely independent of its behavior.


## AutoRegressive (AR)

An AR model is a form of timeseries modelling where the output values of the model depend linearly on previous values in the series and a stochastic term. This model is suitable for use cases where there is a correlation between values in the past and future behavior of the system. An AR model uses $p$ historical lag values to calculate future values.

The equation for an AR model is

$$y_t= \mu  + \sum_{i=1}^{p} \phi_{i} y_{t-i}$$

where

-   $y_t$ is the value of the timeseries at time $t$
-   $y_{t-i}$ is the value of the timeseries at time $t-i$
-   $\mu$ is the trend value
-   $\phi_{i}$ is the lag parameter at time $t-i$

[`.ml.ts.AR.fit`](#mltsarfit)


## AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH)

An ARCH model is a statistical model used to describe the volatility of a timeseries. This models the variance of a point in the data series as a function of the sum the past residual errors squared. This model is appropriate to use when the error variance in the timeseries follows an AR model as described [above](#autoregressive-ar-model). ARCH models are used in timeseries data that experience time-varying volatility and as such are commonly employed in the modeling of financial timeseries exhibiting varying volatility.

The formula for an ARCH model is

$$\hat{\epsilon}_{t}^{2}=\hat{\alpha}_{0}+\sum_{i=1}^{q} \hat{\alpha}_{i} \hat{\epsilon}_{t-i}^2$$

where

-  $\hat{\epsilon}_{t}$ is the residual error term
-  $\hat{\alpha}_{0}$ is the mean term
-  $\hat{\alpha}_{i}$ is past error squared coefficient

:fontawesome-solid-hand-point-right:
[`.ml.ts.ARCH.fit`](#mltsarchfit)


## AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA)

An ARMA model is a timeseries model that is an extension of the [AR model](#autoregressive-ar-model). An ARMA model can be used to describe any weakly stationary stochastic timeseries in terms of two polynomials, the first of these is for autoregression based on `p` lag values, the second for the moving average based on `q` past residual errors.

The equation for the ARMA model is

$$y_t= \mu  + \sum_{i=1}^{p} \phi_{i} y_{t-i} + \sum_{i=1}^{q} \theta_{i} \epsilon_{t-i}$$

Where:

-   $y_t$ is the value of the timeseries at time $t$
-   $\mu$ is the trend value
-   $p$ is the order of lagged values to be accounted for in model generation
-   $q$ is the order of residual errors to be accounted for in model generation
-   $y_{t-i}$ is the value of the timeseries at time $t-i$
-   $\phi_{i}$ is the lag parameter at time $t-i$
-   $\epsilon_{t-i}$ is the residual error term at time $t-i$
-   $\theta_{i}$ is the residual error parameter at time $t-i$

:fontawesome-solid-hand-point-right:
[`.ml.ts.ARMA.fit`](#mltsarmafit)


## AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) 

An ARIMA model is an extension of the [ARMA model](#autoregressive-moving-average-arma-model). As with the ARMA model, this takes into account lagged values and past residual errors when generating the model and predictions. The integrated aspect of the model is the result of differencing the timeseries `d` times in order to generate a ‘stationary’ timeseries.

Once differenced and stationary, an ARMA model can be generated and applied to forecast future values.

Any timeseries which has non-seasonal components (daily/annual cycles) can be modelled using this method.

The equation for an ARIMA model is

$$\hat{y}_{t}= \mu  + \sum_{i=1}^{p} \phi_{i} y_{t-i} + \sum_{i=1}^{q} \theta_{i} \epsilon_{t-i}$$

Where:

-   $\hat{y}_{t}$ is the differenced timeseries at time $t$
-   $\mu$ is the trend value
-   $p$ is the order of lagged values to be accounted for in model generation
-   $q$ is the order of residual errors to be accounted for in model generation
-   $y_{t-i}$ is the value of the timeseries at time $t-i$
-   $\phi_{i}$ is the lag parameter at time $t-i$
-   $\epsilon_{t-i}$ is the residual error term at time $t-i$
-   $\theta_{i}$ is the residual error parameter at time $t-i$


Stationary timeseries

: A timeseries is _stationary_ if its statistical properties such as mean, variance and autocorrelation do not change over time. A timeseries with trends or seasonality are not stationary.

: Differencing can be applied to a non-stationary timeseries in order to make it stationary. This involves computing the difference between consecutive observations in the timeseries a number of times.

: [`stationarity`](misc.md#mltsstationarity) is a function to test if a timeseries or set of timeseries are stationary.


Akaike Information Criterion

: The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is an estimator of in-sample prediction error. It is often used as a means of model selection. Given a collection of models for a dataset, AIC estimates the quality of each model relative to each of the other models and chooses that which minimizes the AIC score.

: In cases where the out-of-sample prediction error is expected to differ from in-sample prediction error it is better to use [cross-validation](../xval.md).

: The equation for calculation of the AIC score for a large sample size is given by:

    $$AIC = 2(k - \hat{L})$$

: where

    -   `k` is the number of estimated parameters for the model.
    -   $\hat{L}$ is the maximum value of the likelihood function for the model being fitted.

## Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA)

A SARIMA model is an extension of the [ARIMA model](#autoregressive-integrated-moving-average-arima-model). As noted previously, ARIMA models cannot be used in cases where there is cyclical variability in the behavior of the timeseries.

Examples of cyclic variability in a timeseries:

-   Sales in many retail stores have yearly cycles with increases in demand around the holidays and during annual sales.
-   The use of electricity in a household has both a yearly and daily cycle with more use during the evening than at night and similarly more use in winter than summer.
-   Weather patterns also contain daily and yearly cycles with temperature changing from day to night and winter to summer

Similar to the ARIMA model which accounts for historical lag components $p$, residual errors $q$ and a set of timeseries differencing $d$, the seasonal component of a SARIMA model has equivalent components.

-   $P$ is the autoregressive lag term of the seasonal component of the model
-   $Q$ is the residual moving average term of the seasonal component model
-   $D$ is the seasonal differencing term of the model

SARIMA models are usually denoted by the following definition

$$ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)_{m}$$

where the upper-case components are as defined above, and $m$ refers to the number of periods in each season.

!!! warning "Consistency across platforms"

    When applying optimization algorithms in kdb+, subtracting small values from large to generate deltas to find the optimization direction may result in inconsistent results across operating systems.

    This is due to potential floating-point precision differences at the machine level and issues with subtractions of floating point numbers more generally. These issues may be seen in the application of `.ml.ts.SARIMA` and `.ml.optimize.BFGS`.
