# About this site


This site is the official documentation for [kdb+](../database/index.md) and the [q programming language](../ref/index.md).

It reflects the work of the Kx community since 1993, has many authors, 
and continues to evolve.  

This site is a project of the Kx Librarian: librarian@kx.com.

> A librarian’s job is to put information where people can find it.
