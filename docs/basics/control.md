Evaluation is controlled by

-   [iterators](../ref/iterators.md) (maps and accumulators) for iteration
-   conditional evaluation
-   explicit return from a lambda
-   signalling and trapping errors
-   control words
-   `exit`

## Iterators

[Iterators](../ref/iterators.md) are the primary means of iterating in q.


### Maps

The [maps](../ref/maps.md) Each, Each Left, Each Right, Each Parallel, and Each Prior are [iterators](../ref/iterators.md) that apply [values](glossary.md#applicable-value) across the items of lists and dictionaries.


### Accumulators

The [accumulators](../ref/accumulators.md) Scan and Over are iterators that apply values _progressively_: that is, first to argument/s, then progressively to the result of each evaluation.

For unary values, they have three forms, known as Converge, Do, and While.


### Case

Case control structures in other languages map values to code or result values. In q this mapping is more often handled by indexing into lists or dictionaries.

```q
q)show v:10?`v1`v2`v3               / values
`v1`v1`v3`v2`v3`v2`v3`v3`v2`v1
q)`r1`r2`r3 `v1`v2`v3?v             / Find
`r1`r1`r3`r2`r3`r2`r3`r3`r2`r1
q)(`v1`v2!`r1`r2) v                 / dictionary: implicit default
`r1`r1``r2``r2```r2`r1
q)`r1`r2`default `v1`v2?v           / explicit default
`r1`r1`default`r2`default`r2`default`default`r2`r1
```

The values mapped can be functions. The pseudocode

```txt
for-each (x in v) {
    switch(x) {
    case `v1:
        `abc,x;
        break;
    case `v2:
        string x;
        break;
    default:
        x;
    }
}
```

can be written in q as

```q
q)((`abc,;string;::) `v1`v2?v)@'v
`abc`v1
`abc`v1
`v3
"v2"
`v3
"v2"
`v3
`v3
"v2"
`abc`v1
```

and optimized with [`.Q.fu`](../ref/dotq.md#qfu-apply-unique).

See also the [Case](../ref/maps.md#case) iterator.


## Control structures

### Conditional evaluation

```txt
$[test;et;ef;…]
```

Cond evaluates and returns `ef` when `test` is zero; else `et`.

In the ternary form, two expressions are evaluated: `test` and either `et` or `ef`. 
With more expressions, Cond implements if/then/elseif… control structures.

:fontawesome-solid-book:
[Cond](../ref/cond.md)

!!! tip "Vector Conditional"

    The [Vector Conditional](../ref/vector-conditional.md) operator, unlike Cond, can be used in [query templates](qsql.md).

    Vector Conditional is an example of a whole class of data-oriented q solutions to problems other languages typically solve with control structures. Data-oriented solutions are typically more efficient and  parallelize well.


### Control words

[`do`](../ref/do.md)

: evaluate some expression/s some number of times

[`if`](../ref/if.md)

: evaluate some expression/s if some condition holds

[`while`](../ref/while.md)

: evaluate some expression/s while some condition holds

Control words are not functions.
They return as a result the [generic null](../ref/identity.md#null). 

!!! warning "Common errors with control words"

    ```q
    a:if[1b;42]43               / instead use Cond
    a:0b;if[a;0N!42]a:1b        / the sequence is not as intended!
    ```


!!! tip "Control words are little used in practice for iteration. [Iterators](../ref/iterators.md) are more commonly used."

 -->
## Explicit return

`:x` has a lambda terminate and return `x`.

:fontawesome-solid-book-open:
[Explicit return](function-notation.md#explicit-return)



## Signalling and trapping errors

[Signal](../ref/signal.md) will exit the lambda under evaluation and signal an error to the expression that invoked it.

<!-- ```q
q)goo:{if[0>type x;'`type]; x cross x}
q)goo 2 3
2 2
2 3
3 2
3 3
q)goo 3
'type
  [0]  goo 3
       ^
```
 -->
[Trap and Trap At](../ref/apply.md#trap) set traps to catch errors.


<!-- ### Common errors

A common error is forgetting to terminate with a semi-colon.
 -->
## `exit`

The [`exit`](../ref/exit.md) keyword terminates kdb+ with the specified return code.
