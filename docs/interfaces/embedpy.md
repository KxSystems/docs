# :fontawesome-brands-python: Calling Python from q (embedPy)


The embedPy library opens [Python](https://www.python.org) to q programmers. This is achieved by loading Python into kdb+ via a C shared object file.

As a result Python variables or objects become q variables or objects and both languages can interact with them. Python code can be embeded within q code, and Python functions can be called as q functions acting on q data. 

A full outline of the available functionality and installation instructions can be found in the [machine-learning section of this website](../ml/embedpy/index.md).
