**Machine-learning** capabilities are at the heart of future technology development at KX. 

Our libraries are released under the Apache 2 license, and are free for all use cases, including 64-bit and commercial use.

## Machine Learning Toolkit

:fontawesome-brands-github:
[KxSystems/ml](https://github.com/KxSystems/ml)

The Machine Learning Toolkit is at the core of our machine-learning functionality. This library contains functions that cover the following areas.

-  Accuracy [metrics](https://github.com/KxSystems/ml/tree/master/util) to test the performance of constructed machine-learning models.
-  [Pre-processing](https://github.com/KxSystems/ml/tree/master/util) data prior to the application of machine-learning algorithms.
-  An implementation of the [FRESH](https://github.com/KxSystems/ml/tree/master/fresh) algorithm for feature extraction and selection on structured time series data. 
-  [Utility](https://github.com/KxSystems/ml/tree/master/util) functions which are useful in many machine-learning applications but do not fall within the other sections of the toolkit.
-  [Cross-Validation](https://github.com/KxSystems/ml/tree/master/xval) functions, used to verify how robust and stable a machine-learning model is to changes in the data being interrogated and the volume of this data.
- [Clustering algorithms](https://github.com/KxSystems/ml/tree/master/clust) used to group data points and to identify patterns in their distributions. The algorithms make use of a [k-dimensional tree](https://github.com/KxSystems/ml/tree/master/clust) to store points and [scoring functions](https://github.com/KxSystems/ml/tree/master/clust) to analyze how well they performed.

### Example notebooks

Example notebooks show FRESH and various aspects of toolkit functionality.


## Natural Language Processing 

:fontawesome-brands-github:
[KxSystems/nlp](https://github.com/KxSystems/nlp)

NLP manages the common functions associated with processing unstructured text. Functions for searching, clustering, keyword extraction and sentiment are included in the library.

## Automated Machine Learning

:fontawesome-brands-github:
[KxSystems/automl](https://github.com/KxSystems/automl)

AutoML is a framework to automate the process of machine learning using kdb+. This is build largely on the machine learning toolkit and handles the following aspects of a traditional machine-learning pipeline:

1.  Data preprocessing
2.  Feature engineering and feature selection
3.  Model selection
4.  Hyperparameter tuning
5.  Report generation and model persistence

## embedPy

:fontawesome-brands-github:
[KxSystems/embedPy](https://github.com/KxSystems/embedpy)

EmbedPy loads Python into kdb+/q, allowing access to a rich ecosystem of libraries such as scikit-learn, tensorflow and pytorch.

-   Python variables and objects become q variables – and either language can act upon them. 
-   Python code and files can be embedded within q code.
-   Python functions can be called as q functions.

## JupyterQ

:fontawesome-brands-github:
[KxSystems/JupyterQ](https://github.com/KxSystems/jupyterq)

JupyterQ supports Jupyter notebooks for q, providing

-   Syntax highlighting, code completion and help
-   Multiline input (script-like execution)
-   Inline display of charts
