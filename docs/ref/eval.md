# `eval`, `reval`

_Evaluate parse trees_





## `eval`

_Evaluate a parse tree_

```syntax
eval x     eval[x]
```

Where `x` is a parse tree, returns the result of evaluating it. 

The `eval` function is the complement of [`parse`](parse.md) and can be used to evaluate the parse trees it returns. (Also parse trees constructed explicitly.)

```q
q)parse "2+3"
+
2
3
q)eval parse "2+3"
5
q)eval (+;2;3)      / constructed explicitly
5
```





## `reval`

_Restricted evaluation of a parse tree_

```syntax
reval x     reval[x]
```

The `reval` function is similar to [`eval`](eval.md), and behaves as if the [command-line option `-b`](../basics/cmdline.md#-b-blocked) were active during evaluation.

An example usage is inside the message handler [`.z.pg`,](dotz.md#zpg-get) useful for access control, here blocking sync messages from updating:

```q
q).z.pg:{reval(value;enlist x)} / define in process listening on port 5000
q)h:hopen 5000 / from another process on same host
q)h"a:4"
'noupdate: `. `a
```

Behaves as if command-line options [`-u 1`](../basics/cmdline.md#-u-usr-pwd) and [`-b`](../basics/cmdline.md#-b-blocked) were active; also blocks all system calls which change state.
That is, all writes to file system are blocked; allows read access to files in working directory and below only; and prevents amendment of globals.
(Since V4.0 2020.03.17.)
The [`exit`](exit.md) keyword is also blocked. (Since V4.1t 2021-07-12.)
