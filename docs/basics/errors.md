nosocket

:   Can only open or use sockets in main thread.

Q7

:   nyi op on file nested array

rank

:   E.g. `+[2;3;4]`

:   Invalid [rank](glossary.md#rank)

rb

:   Encountered a problem while doing a blocking read

restricted

:   E.g. `0"2+3"` in a kdb+ process which was started with [`-b` cmd line](cmdline.md#-b-blocked).

:   Also for a kdb+ process using the username:password authentication file,
    or the `-b` cmd line option, `\x` cannot be used to reset handlers to their default.
    e.g. `\x .z.pg`

s-fail

:   E.g. `` `s#3 2``

:   Invalid attempt to set sorted [attribute](../ref/set-attribute.md).
    Also encountered with `` `s#enums`` when loading a database (`\l db`) and enum target is not already loaded.

splay

:   nyi op on [splayed table](../kb/splayed-tables.md)

stack

:   E.g. `{.z.s[]}[]`

stop

:   User interrupt (Ctrl-c) or [time limit (`-T`)](cmdline.md#-t-timeout)

stype

:   E.g. `'42`

:   Invalid [type](datatypes.md) used for [Signal](../ref/signal.md)

sys

:   E.g. `{system "ls"}peach 0 1`

:   Using system call from thread other than main thread

threadview

:   Trying to calc a [view](../learn/views.md) in a thread other than main thread. A view can be calculated in the main thread only. The cached result can be used from other threads.

timeout

:   Request to `hopen` a handle fails on a timeout; includes message from OS

TLS not enabled

:   Received a TLS connection request, but kdb+ not [started with `-E 1` or `-E 2`](cmdline.md#-e-tls-server-mode)

too many syms

:   Kdb+ currently allows for about 1.4B interned symbols in the pool
    and will exit with this error when this threshold is reached


trunc

:   The log had a partial transaction at the end but q couldn’t truncate the file

type

:   E.g. `til 2.2`

:   Wrong [type](datatypes.md). Also see `limit`

type/attr error amending file

:   Direct update on disk for this type or attribute is not allowed

u-fail

:   E.g. `` `u#2 2``

:   Invalid attempt to set unique or parted [attribute](../ref/set-attribute.md)

unmappable

:   E.g.
    ```q
    t:([]sym:`a`b;a:(();()))
    .Q.dpft[`:thdb;.z.d;`sym;`t]
    ```

:   When saving partitioned data each column must be mappable. `()` and `("";"";"")` are OK

unrecognized key format

:   E.g. ``-36!(`:kf;"pwd")``

:   Master keyfile format not recognized

upd

:   Function `upd` is undefined (sometimes encountered during ``-11!`:logfile``) _or_ [license error](#license-errors)

utf8

:   The websocket requires that text is UTF-8 encoded

value

:   No value

vd1

:   Attempted multithread update

view

:   Tried to re-assign a [view](../learn/views.md) to something else

-w abort

:   [`malloc`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_dynamic_memory_allocation) hit [`-w` limit](cmdline.md#-w-workspace) or [`\w` limit](syscmds.md#w-workspace)

-w init via cmd line

:   Trying to allocate memory with [`\w`](syscmds.md#w-workspace) without `-w` on command line

wsfull

:   E.g. `999999999#0`

:   [`malloc`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_dynamic_memory_allocation) failed, or ran out of swap (or addressability on 32-bit).
    The params also reported are intended to help KX diagnose when assisting clients, and are subject to change.

wsm

:   E.g. `010b wsum 010b`

:   Alias for `nyi` for `wsum` prior to V3.2

XXX

:   E.g. `delete x from system "d";x`

:   Value error (`XXX` undefined)



## System errors

From file ops and [IPC](ipc.md)

error        | explanation
-------------|------------
Bad CPU Type | Tried to run 32-bit interpreter in macOS 10.15+
`XXX:YYY`    | `XXX` is from kdb+, `YYY` from the OS

`XXX` from addr, close, conn, p(from `-p`), snd, rcv or (invalid) filename, e.g. ``read0`:invalidname.txt``



## Parse errors
On execute or load

error | example / explanation
------|----------------------
`[({])}"` | `"hello`<br><br>Open `([{` or `"`
branch | `a:"1;",65024#"0;"`<br/>`value "{if[",a,"]}"`<br><br>A branch (`if`;`do`;`while`;`$[.;.;.]`) more than 65025 byte codes away<br>(255 before V3.6 2017.09.26)
char | `value "\000"`<br><br>Invalid character (watch out for non-breaking spaces in copied expressions)
globals | `a:"::a"sv string til 111;`<br/>`value"{a",a,"::0}"`<br><br>Too many [global variables](function-notation.md#variables-and-constants)
limit | `a:";"sv string 2+til 241;`<br/>`value"{",a,"}"`<br><br>Too many [constants](function-notation.md#variables-and-constants), or :fontawesome-regular-hand-point-right: [limit error](#runtime-errors)
locals | `a:":a"sv string til 111;`<br/>`value"{a",a,":0}"`<br><br>Too many [local variables](function-notation.md#variables-and-constants)
params | `f:{[a;b;c;d;e;f;g;h;e]}`<br><br>Too many parameters (8 max)


## License errors
On launch

error | explanation
------|------------
{timestamp} couldn't connect to license daemon | Could not connect to KX license server ([kdb+ On Demand](../learn/licensing.md#licensing-server-for-kdb-on-demand))
cores | The license is for [fewer cores than available](../kb/cpu-affinity.md)
cpu | The license is for fewer CPUs than available
exp | License expiry date is prior to system date
host | The hostname reported by the OS does not match the hostname or hostname-pattern in the license.<br><br>If you see `255.255.255.255` in the kdb+ banner, the machine almost certainly cannot resolve its hostname to an IP address, which will cause a `host` error.
k4.lic | `k4.lic` file not found, check contents of environment variables [`QHOME`](../learn/install.md#step-2-put-kdb-in-qhome) and [`QLIC`](../learn/licensing.md#keeping-the-license-key-file-elsewhere)
os | Wrong OS or operating-system error (if runtime error)
srv | Client-only license in server mode
upd | Version of kdb+ more recent than update date, _or_ the function `upd` is undefined (sometimes encountered during ``-11!`:logfile``)
user | Unlicensed user
wha | System date is prior to kdb+ version date
wrong q.k version | `q` and `q.k` versions do not match


License-related errors are reported with the prefix `licence error: ` since V4.0 2019.10.22.

[Licensing](../learn/licensing.md)


## Handling errors

Use system command [`\` (abort)](syscmds.md#terminate) to clear one level off the execution stack.

Keyword [`exit`](../ref/exit.md) terminates the kdb+ process.

Use hook [`.z.exit`](../ref/dotz.md#zexit-action-on-exit) to set a callback on process exit.

Use [Signal](../ref/signal.md) to signal errors.

Use [Trap and Trap At](../ref/apply.md#trap) to trap errors.
