### Commercial 

Commercial versions of kdb+ are available to customers from [downloads.kx.com](https://downloads.kx.com). (Credentials for this site are issued to customers’ [Designated Contacts](../licensing.md#obtain-a-license-key-file)). 

!!! tip "Internal distribution"

    Most customers download the latest release of kdb+ (along with the accompanying README.txt, the detailed change list) and make a limited number of approved kdb+ versions available from a central file server. 

    Designated Contacts should encourage developers to keep production systems up to date with these versions of kdb+. This can greatly simplify development, deployment and debugging.


## Platforms and versions

The names of the ZIPs denote the platform (`l64.zip` – 64-bit Linux; `w32.zip` – 32-bit Windows, etc.).

Numerical release versions of the form 2.8, or 3.5 are production code. Versions of kdb+ with a trailing `t` in the name such as `3.7t` are test versions and are neither intended nor supported for production use.
