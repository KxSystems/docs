_Read and parse, or write bytes_



> There are 10 types of people: those who use binary arithmetic and those who don’t. 


## Read Binary

```syntax
x 1: y     1:[x;y]
```

Where 

-   `x` is a 2-item list (a string of [types](#column-types-and-widths) and an int vector of widths) of which the order determines whether the data is parsed as little-endian or big-endian
-   `y` is a [file descriptor](../basics/glossary.md#file-descriptor) or string, or byte sequence

returns the content of `y` as a matrix.

```q
q)(enlist 4;enlist"i")1:0x01000000                  / big endian
16777216
q)(enlist"i";enlist 4)1:0x01000000                  / little endian
1
q)show pi:(enlist"f";enlist 8)1:0x7fbdc282fb210940  / pi as little endian 64-bit float
3.141593
q).Q.s1 pi                                          / 1×1 matrix
",,3.141593"
```

Read two records containing an integer, a character and a short from a byte sequence. Note the integer is read with a 4-byte width, the character with 1 byte and the short with 2 bytes. (When reading byte sequences, recall that a byte is 2 hex digits.)

```q
q)("ich";4 1 2)1:0x00000000410000FF00000042FFFF
0 255
A B
0 -1

q)("ich";4 1 2)1:"arthur!"
1752461921
u
8562
```

With `offset` and `length`:

```q
/load 500000 records, 100000 at a time
q)d:raze{("ii";4 4)1:(`:/tmp/data;x;100000)}each 100000*til 5
```


### Column types and widths

```txt
b        boolean         1
g        guid            16
x        byte            1
h        short           2
i        int             4
j        long            8
e        real            4
f        float           8
c        char            1
s        symbol          n
p        timestamp       8
m        month           4
d        date            4
z        datetime        8
n        timespan        8
u        minute          4
v        second          4
t        time            4
(blank)  skip           
```

## Save Binary

```syntax
filesymbol 1: bytes     1:[filesymbol;bytes]
```

writes `bytes` to [`filesymbol`](../basics/glossary.md#file-symbol) and returns it. If `filesymbol`

-   does not exist, it is created, with any required directories
-   exists, it is overwritten

```q
q)`:hello 1: 0x68656c6c6f776f726c64
`:hello
```
