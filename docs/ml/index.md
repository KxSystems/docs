**Machine-learning** capabilities are at the heart of future technology development at KX. Libraries are added here as they are released. Libraries are released under the Apache 2 license, and are free for all use cases, including 64-bit and commercial use.

[How to set up](setup.md) kdb+/q to create a machine-learning environment using either Anaconda, Docker or a manual build

## Anaconda


Users can now install kdb+/q along with our supported Python and Machine Learning libraries, embedPy and JupyterQ using the popular [Anaconda](https://anaconda.com/) package-management system `conda`.


## embedPy

[EmbedPy](embedpy/index.md) loads Python into kdb+/q, allowing access to a rich ecosystem of libraries such as scikit-learn, tensorflow and pytorch.

-   Python variables and objects become q variables – and either language can act upon them. 
-   Python code and files can be embedded within q code.
-   Python functions can be called as q functions.

Example notebooks using embedPy:

## JupyterQ

[JupyterQ](jupyterq/index.md) supports Jupyter notebooks for q, providing

-   Syntax highlighting, code completion and help
-   Multiline input (script-like execution)
-   Inline display of charts


## Machine Learning Toolkit

The [Machine Learning Toolkit](toolkit/index.md) is at the core of kdb+/q centered machine-learning functionality. This library contains functions that cover the following areas.

-  Accuracy [metrics](toolkit/utilities/metric.md) to test the performance of constructed machine-learning models.
-  [Pre-processing](toolkit/utilities/preproc.md) data prior to the application of machine-learning algorithms.
-  An implementation of the [FRESH](toolkit/fresh.md) algorithm for feature extraction and selection on structured time series data. 
-  [Utility](toolkit/utilities/util.md) functions which are useful in many machine-learning applications but do not fall within the other sections of the toolkit.
-  [Cross-Validation](toolkit/xval.md) functions, used to verify how robust and stable a machine-learning model is to changes in the data being interrogated and the volume of this data.
- [Clustering algorithms](toolkit/clustering/algos.md) used to group data points and to identify patterns in their distributions. The algorithms make use of a [k-dimensional tree](toolkit/clustering/kdtree.md) to store points and [scoring functions](toolkit/clustering/score.md) to analyze how well they performed.

## Natural Language Processing 

[NLP](nlp/index.md) was the first module within the machine-learning suite, it manages the common functions associated with processing unstructured text. Functions for searching, clustering, keyword extraction and sentiment are included in the library, available [here](https://github.com/KxSystems/nlp).

## Automated Machine Learning

[AutoML](automl/index.md) is a framework to automate the process of machine learning using kdb+. This is build largely on the machine learning toolkit and handles the following aspects of a traditional machine-learning pipeline:

1. Data preprocessing
2. Feature engineering and feature selection
3. Model selection
4. Hyperparameter tuning
5. Report generation and model persistence
