# Starting kdb+





This is a quick-start guide to kdb+, aimed primarily at those learning independently. It covers system installation, the kdb+ environment, IPC, tables and typical databases, and where to find more material. After completing this you should be able to follow the Borror textbook [Q for Mortals](/q4m3/), and the [Reference](../../ref/index.md).

One caution: you can learn kdb+ reasonably well by independent study, but for serious deployment of the product you need the help of a consultant. This is because kdb+ is typically used for very demanding applications that require experience to set up properly. Contact KX for help with such evaluations.


## Kdb+

The kdb+ system is both a database and a programming language.
  
-   **kdb+**: the database (_k database plus_)
-   **q**: a general-purpose programming language integrated with kdb+


## Resources

### :fontawesome-solid-globe: code.kx.com

The best resource for learning q. It includes:

-   Jeff Borror’s textbook [Q for Mortals](/q4m3/)
-   a [Reference](../../ref/index.md) for the built-in functions
-   [interfaces](../../interfaces/index.md) with other languages and processes


### :fontawesome-brands-github: GitHub

- the [KxSystems](https://github.com/KxSystems) repositories
- [user-contributed repositories](https://kxsystems.github.io)

<!--
### Other material

Several background articles and links can be found in the [Archive](../archive.md). For example, the Thalesians’ [Knowledge Base Kdb](http://www.thalesians.com/finance/index.php/Knowledge_Base/Databases/Kdb) has a good overview.

### Discussion groups

-   The main discussion forum is the [k4 Topicbox](https://k4.topicbox.com/groups/k4). This is available only to licensed customers – please use a work email address to [apply for access](https://k4.topicbox.com/groups/k4?subscription_form=e1ca20f8-95f6-11e8-8090-9973fa3f0106).
-   The [Kdb+ Personal Developers](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/personal-kdbplus) forum is an open Google discussion group for users of the free system.


## :fontawesome-solid-download: Install free system

If you do not already have access to a licensed copy, go to [Get started](../index.md) to download and install q.


## :fontawesome-solid-file: Example files

Two sets of scripts are referenced in this guide:

1. The free system is distributed with the following example scripts in the main directory:

    -   `sp.q` – the Suppliers and Parts sample database
    -   `trade.q` – a stock trades sample database

    If you do not have these scripts, get them from 
    :fontawesome-brands-github: [KxSystems/kdb](https://github.com/KxSystems/kdb) 
    and save them in your `QHOME` directory.

2. Other example files are in the :fontawesome-brands-github: [KxSystems/cookbook/start](https://github.com/KxSystems/cookbook/tree/master/start) directory. 

    Move the `start` directory under your `QHOME` directory, e.g. `q/start`. For example, there should be a file:

    === ":fontawesome-brands-linux: Linux :fontawesome-brands-apple: macOS"

            ~/q/start/buildhdb.q
    
    === ":fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows"

            c:\q\start\buildhdb.q


!!! tip "Text editor for :fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows"

    Since q source is in plain text files, it is worth installing a good text editor such as Notepad++ or Notepad2.

    Some text editors have extensions to provide e.g. syntax highlighting for q. See the [list of editor integrations](../../interfaces/index.md#editor-integrations)


## Graphical user interface

When q is run, it displays a console where you can enter commands and see the results. This is all you need to follow the tutorial, and if you just want to learn a little about q, then it is easiest to work in the console.

As you become more familiar with q, you may prefer to work in the interactive development environment [**KX Developer**](/developer/). ([_Kx Analyst_](/analyst/) is the enterprise version of Developer.)
